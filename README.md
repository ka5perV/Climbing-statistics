# Climbing statistics - PowerBI visualization 

 **For this assignment, I will be presenting data on several key aspects of rock climbing progression:** 
-	Average grade achieved by climbers. 
-	Duration required to reach V6, a common goal among climbers. 
-	Types of training methods commonly used to supplement climbing. 
-	Physical differences that contribute to success in climbing progression

## Data source

I will collect raw data from a survey conducted on https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/. This survey received **over 600 responses** and includes a wide range of information, from climbers' height and weight to their training habits. While some data cleaning may be necessary, it should not be overly complex.

    Sex, Height (cm), Weight (KG), Arm Span (cm), How long have you been climbing for?, Where do you climb?, Hardest V Grade ever climbed, Hardest V Grade climbed in the Last 3 months,
    The V grade you can send 90-100% of routes, Hardest Route grade climbed (Ewbank grade), Hardest route climbed last 3 months (ewbank), Route grade you can send 90-100% of climbs,
    Frequency of climbing sessions per week, Average hours climbing per week (not including training), Average hours Training for climbing per week, Hangboard Frequency per week,
    Hangboard grips used, Style of Hangboarding chosen, Max Weight hangboard 18mm edge - Half crimp (KG) (10 seconds) (added weight only), Max Weight hangboard 18mm edge - open crimp (KG) (10 seconds) (added weight only),
    "Min Edge used (mm, +kg if weight added ) - Half Crimp (10 seconds)", "Min Edge used (mm, +kg if weight added) - Open crimp (10 seconds)", Campus Board frequency per week, Campus Board time per week (hours),
    Frequency of Endurance training sessions per week, Endurance training, General Strength Training frequency per week, Time spent General strength training (hours), Type of Strength training, "Other activities (ie yoga, cardio)", Max pull up reps, 5 rep max weighted pull ups, max push ups reps, max L-sit time. 

 

## Planned visualization

## Why i chose this approach 
I have chosen to use area charts to illustrate trends in climbing grades over time because they offer a clear depiction of climbing ability progression across different years. Additionally, I plan to use cards to summarize key values, simplifying the presentation of larger datasets. Pie charts will be employed when comparing or highlighting specific categories within the dataset, providing a concise visual comparison.

## Final product - PowerBI
